# Alphabets

## RFC4648 Base32

RFC4648 is a specification that defines several encoding schemes for binary data representation as text strings.
It includes different variations such as Base64, Base32, Base16 (hexadecimal), and Base58.
It is commonly used for encoding binary data in a text format, such as in email attachments or cryptographic applications.

### Characteristics of RFC4648 Base32

- **Case-insensitive**: The encoding is case-insensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as equivalent.
- The alphabet consists of the uppercase alphabets `A-Z` and the digits `2-7`.
- It does not include characters that can be easily confused, such as `0` and `O`, or `1` and `I`.

## Crockford's Base32

Crockford encoding is a variation of Base32 encoding created by [Douglas Crockford](https://www.crockford.com/base32.html).
It is primarily used for encoding and decoding numbers in a compact and human-readable format.
It is often used in applications where numbers need to be represented as strings, such as in URL shortening or error-checking algorithms.

### Characteristics of Crockford's Base32

- The alphabet consists of the digits `0-9` and the uppercase alphabets `A-H`, `J-N`, and `P-Z`, excluding `I`, `L`, `O`, and `U`.
- It does not include characters that can be easily confused, such as `0` and `O`, or `1` and `I`.
- It includes additional characters (`*`, `~`, `$`, `=`, `U`) for checksums.

## Base32 Hex

Base32hex is another variation of Base32 encoding that uses a different character set.
The Base32hex alphabet consists of 32 characters: 0-9 and A-V.
It is similar to RFC4648 Base32, but it uses a different set of characters for encoding.
Base32hex is commonly used in applications where case-insensitivity is required, as it only includes uppercase letters.

### Characteristics of Base32 Hex

- The alphabet consists of the digits `0-9` and the uppercase alphabets `A-V`.
- It is case-insensitive, like RFC4648 Base32.
- It is designed to preserve the sort order of the encoded data, meaning that if the binary data is sorted, the encoded data will also be sorted.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, RFC4648, Crockford, and Base32hex are different variations of Base32 encoding with different character sets.
They are used for encoding binary data or representing numbers in a text format.

The choice of which encoding to use depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as case-sensitivity, character set limitations, or compatibility with existing systems.
